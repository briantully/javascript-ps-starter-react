      <p>Welcome to the React version of the Acquia PS JS generator.
        This is a sample application created by the generator for typical React & Redux workflows, so head over to <a href="/sample">sample application</a> to test.
        The tools and configuration are just as important as the sample components, so make sure to read thru the features included in the README.md.
